<h1>ThreadHelper FAQ</h1>


<ol>

<li><strong>What is it?</strong>
<p>

    ThreadHelper is a browser extension that sits on the right hand side of the Twitter screen.
</p>
<p>

    It looks something like this:
</p>
<p>

<img src="assets/img/faq1.png" style="width:100%" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip">

</p>


<li><strong>What is it for?</strong>
</li>
</li>

<p>
ThreadHelper finds the tweets you need.
</p>


<li><strong>How does it work?</strong>
<p>

    As you type, ThreadHelper searches a combination of the following: your previous tweets, your retweets and your bookmarks (chosen by you) for tweets that are semantically relevant.<br>
</p>


<li><strong>‚ÄúSemantically relevant‚Äù...?</strong>
<p>

    Yes: about the same topic. So if you‚Äôre tweeting about your best friend John today and you tweeted about friendship a month ago, those tweets will pop back up.
</p>


<li><strong>Why should I care about that?</strong>
<p>

    Imagine that, as you had a new thought, all the relevant thoughts you ever had about that topic that were presently relevant were available. That‚Äôs what ThreadHelper is giving you. Sweet, right? You can get it <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threadhelper/nfadnflafdfmekapgcgddbccooagpndk">here</a>.
</p>


<li><strong>This doesn‚Äôt really seem relevant to me‚Ä¶ </strong>
<p>

    That‚Äôs ok! There‚Äôs a few different ways we‚Äôve seen people using it. Some people mainly crawl retweets so that they find things their friends said about whatever they‚Äôre thinking about now. Imagine having all your <em>friends' thoughts</em> about the topic. Also makes it real easy to start conversations, pick up on lost threads, and so on.
</p>
<p>

    Another way people have been using it is mainly to find their own thoughts on a topic. Either because they wanna create big personal libraries or Wikis (Memexes) of all of their thoughts put together and how they all connect <em>or </em>because they‚Äôre some sort of creator or writer and want to compile their thinking into blog posts or books. It isn‚Äôt hard to write a book on a topic when you can easily find your 5k previous thoughts on it.
</p>
<p>

    If it still doesn‚Äôt seem relevant, maybe that‚Äôs the case! It‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs us.

<li><strong>How can I learn more?</strong>
<p>

    You can check out the tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voCpNvldCjk&feature=emb_title">here</a>, and you can install it <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threadhelper/nfadnflafdfmekapgcgddbccooagpndk">here</a>.
</p>


<li><strong>How can I give feedback? How can I report bugs?</strong>
<p>

    If you click on the ThreadHelper extension icon you will find a mini-tutorial. At the end you‚Äôll find a form where you can give us feedback or report bugs.
</p>


<li><strong>I love ThreadHelper! How can I support you? </strong>
<p>

    Your love is all we need :) If you wanna push it further we‚Äôd be happy if you wrote us a review <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/threadhelper/nfadnflafdfmekapgcgddbccooagpndk">here</a> (it de-risks trying the product for others) or wrote about it on Twitter and @-ed us at  @nosilverv and @exgenesis.
</p>


<li><strong>Do you get my personal data? </strong>
<p>

    <strong>No. </strong>We don‚Äôt have servers and ThreadHelper lives on your browser. It communicates with Twitter directly. We do use Google Analytics to gain insight into how people in general are finding it and using it, but can‚Äôt see any specific user‚Äôs use. 
</p>


<li><strong>Who built ThreadHelper?</strong>
<p>

    ThreadHelper was built by @nosilverv and @exgenesis with a grant from George Mason University's Mercatus Center's <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures">Emergent Ventures</a> fund.
</p>


<li><strong>How can I keep up with ThreadHelper?</strong>
