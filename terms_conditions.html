  description or price of the product or service, error in your order or other
  reasons.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order if fraud or an
  unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>• <span
  style="text-decoration:underline;">Subscriptions</span></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis
  (“<strong>Subscription(s)</strong>”). You will be billed in advance on a
  recurring and periodic basis (“<strong>Billing Cycle</strong>”). Billing cycles
  are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of
  subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew
  under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or THREADHELPER, INC.
  cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online
  account management page or by contacting THREADHELPER, INC. customer support
  team.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the
  payment for your subcription. You shall provide THREADHELPER, INC. with accurate
  and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code,
  telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such
  payment information, you automatically authorize THREADHELPER, INC. to charge
  all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment
  instruments.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, THREADHELPER, INC.
  will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually,
  within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the
  billing period as indicated on the invoice.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Free
  Trial</span></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      THREADHELPER, INC. may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a
  free trial for a limited period of time (“<strong>Free Trial</strong>”).
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up
  for Free Trial.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      If you do enter your billing information when signing up for Free Trial, you
  will not be charged by THREADHELPER, INC. until Free Trial has expired. On the
  last day of Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will
  be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of
  Subscription you have selected.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      At any time and without notice, THREADHELPER, INC. reserves the right to (i)
  modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial
  offer.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      <strong>• <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fee
  Changes</span></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
      THREADHELPER, INC., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
  Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become
  effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      THREADHELPER, INC. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any
  change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your
  Subscription before such change becomes effective.
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>
  <p>
      Your continued use of Service after Subscription fee change comes into
  effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
  </p>
  <p>
